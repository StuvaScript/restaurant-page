After gaining some proficiency in using npm and webpack, I'm applying this new knowledge to a restaurant webpage, optimizing its performance by bundling JavaScript files and managing dependencies with npm, resulting in faster load times and improved user experience!

Uses: HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript, Webpack, Node.js
